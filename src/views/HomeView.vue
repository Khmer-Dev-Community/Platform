      At its core, a community website is designed to host spaces that facilitate discussions,
      collaboration on projects, customer support, and more among groups of users, be it customers
      or tech professionals. These spaces are live, ongoing, and both organic and interactive. It’s
      important to note they are different from generic website templates. This is because community
      website templates come with advanced features that allow for the categorization of topics,
      moderation tools, advanced customization, analytics, integration capabilities, and more —
      thanks to the community software platform they are built on. In essence, a community website
      bridges the gap between businesses and their audience. It transforms passive consumers into
      active participants, fostering a sense of belonging and community. It's a goldmine for
      insights, allowing businesses to ultimately align their products more closely with user needs
      and preferences.
